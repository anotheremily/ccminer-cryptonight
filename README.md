# ccminer-cryptonight
This is a CUDA accelerated mining application for use with Monero and other coins based on the Cryptonight algorithm. A modification of Christian Buchner's & Christian H.'s ccminer project by tsiv for Cryptonight mining.

THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS-IS", USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Installation
Requires CUDA SDK 6.0 which can be found here: https://developer.nvidia.com/linux-tegra-rel-19

Direct link: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_0/rel/installers/cuda-repo-l4t-r19.2_6.0-42_armhf.deb

Make sure the system is up to date and the installer in `NVIDIA-INSTALLER` has been run.

Then download the 6.0 SDK and install using these instructions: http://elinux.org/Jetson/Installing_CUDA (included below.)

	# Install the CUDA repo metadata that you downloaded manually for L4T
	sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-l4t-r19.2_6.0-42_armhf.deb
	# Download & install the actual CUDA Toolkit including the OpenGL toolkit from NVIDIA. (It only downloads around 15MB)
	sudo apt-get update
	# Install "cuda-toolkit-6-0" if you downloaded CUDA 6.0, or "cuda-toolkit-6-5" if you downloaded CUDA 6.5, etc.
	sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit-6-0
	# Add yourself to the "video" group to allow access to the GPU
	sudo usermod -a -G video $USER

	# Add the 32-bit CUDA paths to your .bashrc login script, and start using it in your current console:
	echo "# Add CUDA bin & library paths:" >> ~/.bashrc
	echo "export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
	echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc

The following instructions may be simplified later, but for now:

- Run toolchain

    aclocal
    autoheader
    automake --add-missing --copy --gnu
    autoconf
    ./configure "CFLAGS=-O3" "CXXFLAGS=-O3" --with-cuda=/usr/local/cuda
    make

So far it doesn't seem the Jetson performs well at all (worse than expected.) Looking into if this can be improved.

## Command Line Options
This code is based on the main ccminer branch, that in turn is based on the pooler cpuminer 2.3.2 release and inherits most of their command line interface and options.

    -d, --devices         Gives a comma separated list of CUDA device IDs
                          to operate on. Device IDs start counting from 0!
                          Alternatively give string names of your card like
                          gtx780ti or gt640#2 (matching 2nd gt640 in the PC).
    -l, --launch=CONFIG   Launch config for the Cryptonight kernel.
                          a comma separated list of values in form of
                          AxB where A is the number of threads to run in
                          each thread block and B is the number of thread
                          blocks to launch. If less values than devices in use
                          are provided, the last value will be used for
                          the remaining devices. If you don't need to vary the
                          value between devices, you can just enter a single
    	                    value and it will be used for all devices.
    	                    (default: 8x40)
    --bfactor=X           Enables running the Cryptonight kernel in smaller
                          pieces. The kernel will be run in 2^X parts according to bfactor, with a small pause between parts, specified by --bsleep.
                          This is a per-device setting like the launch config.
                          (default: 0 (no splitting) on Linux, 6 (64 parts) on Windows)
    --bsleep=X            Insert a delay of X microseconds between kernel
                          launches.
                          Use in combination with --bfactor to mitigate the lag
                          when running on your primary GPU.
                          This is a per-device setting like the launch config.
    -f, --diff            Divide difficulty by this factor (std is 1)
    -o, --url=URL         URL of mining server (default: " DEF_RPC_URL ")
    -O, --userpass=U:P    username:password pair for mining server
    -u, --user=USERNAME   username for mining server
    -p, --pass=PASSWORD   password for mining server
    --cert=FILE           certificate for mining server using SSL
    -x, --proxy=[PROTOCOL://]HOST[:PORT]  connect through a proxy
    -t, --threads=N       number of miner threads
                          (default: number of nVidia GPUs in your system)
    -r, --retries=N       number of times to retry if a network call fails
                          (default: retry indefinitely)
    -R, --retry-pause=N   time to pause between retries, in seconds
                          (default: 15)
    -T, --timeout=N       network timeout, in seconds (default: 270)
    -s, --scantime=N      upper bound on time spent scanning current work when
                          long polling is unavailable, in seconds (default: 5)
    --no-longpoll         disable X-Long-Polling support
    --no-stratum          disable X-Stratum support
    -q, --quiet           disable per-thread hashmeter output
    -D, --debug           enable debug output
    -P, --protocol-dump   verbose dump of protocol-level activities
    -B, --background      run the miner in the background
       --benchmark        run in offline benchmark mode
    -c, --config=FILE     load a JSON-format configuration file
    -V, --version         display version information and exit
    -h, --help            display this help text and exit

## Updates

### September 3rd 2016
Fork for Jetson TK1. See above for installation instructions.

### July 5th 2014
Massive improvement to interactivity on Windows, should also further help with TDR issues. Introducing the --bfactor and --bsleep command line parameters allows for control over execution of the biggest resource hog of the algorithm. Use bfactor to determine how many parts the kernel is split into and bsleep to insert a short delay between the kernel launches. The defaults are no splitting / no sleep for Linux and split into 64 (bfactor 6) parts / sleep 100 microseconds between launches for Windows. These defaults seem to work wonders on my 750 Ti on Windows 7, once again you may want to tweak according to your
environment.

In other news, I just yanked out the code for other alrogithms. This is now a cryptonight-only miner.

### June 24th 2014
Initial release, compiles and runs on Linux and Windows. Documentation is scarce and probably will be, see README.txt and ccminer --help for the basics.

Before you read further (and you should), I highly recommend running Linux. There are some issues with running on Windows that are

Do note that the cryptonight kernel on this release is FAT and SLOW, and pretty much makes your Windows computer unusable while running. If you plan on running it on your primary desktop with only a single GPU... Well, just don't think you'll be using the computer for anything. I haven't tested it, but I'd expect it'll be fine if you have multiple GPUs on the system and you run the miner only on the cards that don't have a display attached. You'll still have the TDR issue to deal with though:

The kernel also tends to turn just long enough for Windows to think the GPU crashed and trigger the driver timeout detection and recovery. This is where the kernel launch option (-l) hopefully comes in.

The default launch is 40 tread blocks of 8 threads each. Don't know why, but at least my 750 Ti seems to like 8 thread blocks best. 40 blocks of 8 is something that, once again on my 750 ti, manages to run fast enough to finish before the Windows default 2 second timeout. Basically enables you to run the damn thing without the driver crashing instantly, which is why I made it the default. Since I only have that one single 750 Ti to test on Windows, I haven't got the slightest clue how it works on other GPUs. Your mileage may vary.

I peaked out my hashrate with 60 blocks of 8 threads, you'll just have to experiment with it until (if) you find the sweet spot for your cards. Do keep in mind that cryptonight needs 2 MB of memory for each hash, that would mean about 960 MB of GPU memory for the 8x60 config. Keep that and the amount of memory on your card in mind while playing around with the numbers.
